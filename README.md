# This Repo

This repo contains class materials for Kevin Sullivan's Engineering Logic course. 
- The *assignments* folder is where homework assignments will be posted
- The *inClassNotes* directory contains notes produce for and presented and often edited in class. These files should reflect exactly what students saw in class. 
- The *profNotes* directory contains subsequently cleaned up and often better-annotated versions of these files. 
- The *zzz_junk* directory is a scratch area for the instructor. I will never ask you to explore it, and there's no real reason to do so, but, hey, if you're bored, have at it.
